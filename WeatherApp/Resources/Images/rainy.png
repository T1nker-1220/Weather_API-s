The contents of the file `/WeatherApp/WeatherApp/Resources/Images/rainy.png` should be the actual image file for the rainy weather background. Since it is an image file, it cannot be generated programmatically. You can either create or obtain an image file representing the rainy weather background and place it in the specified location within your project.
