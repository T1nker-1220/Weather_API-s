The contents of the file `/WeatherApp/WeatherApp/Resources/Images/cloudy.png` should be an image file representing the background image for cloudy weather. 

Since it is an image file, there is no need to generate any specific code contents for it. You can simply create or obtain an image file named `cloudy.png` and place it in the specified location within your project's directory structure.
