The contents of the file `/WeatherApp/WeatherApp/Resources/Images/foggy.png` should be the image resource for the foggy weather background. 

Since it's an image file, you don't need to provide any specific code contents. You can simply save the image file `foggy.png` in the `Resources/Images` folder of your project. 

Make sure the image file is in a compatible format (such as PNG) and has the appropriate dimensions and resolution for your application.
