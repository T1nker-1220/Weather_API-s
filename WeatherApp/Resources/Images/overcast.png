The contents of the file `/WeatherApp/WeatherApp/Resources/Images/overcast.png` should be the image file for the background image representing overcast weather. 

Since it is an image file, the contents of the file will be binary data. You can obtain the binary data for the image from a source or create it using an image editing tool. 

Please note that as an AI text-based model, I am unable to generate binary data for image files. You can use an image editing tool or obtain the image file from a reliable source and save it as `overcast.png` in the specified location within your project.
